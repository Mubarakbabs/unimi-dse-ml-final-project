#Hello! I'm Mubarak Babslawal

## And this is my submission for my Machine Learning Project

A quick guide to navigating this folder:
For my project, I chose to answer the question of building a tree predictor from scratch.

The report folder contains the report both in pdf and Latex, as well as other files automatically generated by the VS Code Latex plugin while generating the pdf file

The scripts folder contains the two python files: DecisionTree.py[] and utils.py

Finally, the full step-by-step analysis is contained in the Mushroom Analysis Jupyter Notebook.

Happy analysing!
