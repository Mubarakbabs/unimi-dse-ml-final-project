# Hello! I'm Mubarak Babslawal

## And this is my submission for my Machine Learning Project

A quick guide to navigating this folder:
For my project, I chose to answer the question of building a tree predictor from scratch.

The report folder contains the report both in [pdf](https://github.com/Mubarakbabs/unimi-dse-ml-final-project/blob/main/report/Mushroom%20Analysis%20report.pdf) and [Latex](https://github.com/Mubarakbabs/unimi-dse-ml-final-project/blob/main/report/Mushroom%20Analysis%20report.tex) formats, as well as other files automatically generated by the VS Code Latex plugin while generating the pdf file

The scripts folder contains the two python files: [DecisionTree.py](https://github.com/Mubarakbabs/unimi-dse-ml-final-project/blob/main/scripts/DecisionTree.py) and [utils.py](https://github.com/Mubarakbabs/unimi-dse-ml-final-project/blob/main/scripts/utils.py)

Finally, the full step-by-step analysis is contained in the [Mushroom Analysis](https://github.com/Mubarakbabs/unimi-dse-ml-final-project/blob/main/Mushroom%20Analysis.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

Happy analysing!
